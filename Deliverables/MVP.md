# NBA Regression Analysis

Data was scraped from basketball-reference.com, from the 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2018-19 NBA seasons.

Utilizing a large number of features within a dataframe, I created an initial model:

![](/Visualizations/usg_rate_plot.png)

As seen below, many of these features have correlative relationships with usage rate, however, some do not have strong correlation, and will need to be removed.


![](/Visualizations/heatmap.png)


The R-squared value for this model was 0.756.
