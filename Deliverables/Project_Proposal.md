# NBA Regression Project Proposal

#### Question:

In the NBA, injuries seem incredibly unpredictable, and can often pose significant complications on teams' performances throughout the season. There have been many ideas on player susceptibility to injury based on many factors, including the physical composition of the player to usage rate and style of play.

NBA teams make decisions based on players' history and physical attributes, but how much of these actually indicate the possibility of injury occuring?

How can teams make more informed decisions to either lower injury probability, or avoid over-investing in those with high likelihood of injury?

What qualities of players make them more prone to injury?
* Do injuries happen more often to taller or shorter players?
* Does weight-height ratio play a role in injury?
* How much does injury history affect the chances of re-injury?


#### Data Description:
* Datasets provided on basketball-reference.com
* Data over player career for players in years where most major metrics have been recorded
* Possible external data for player physical attributes


#### Algorithms:
* Linear regression in python
* Rigorous model selection & evaluation

#### Tools:
* Webscraping:
  - BeautifulSoup & Selenium


#### MVP Goal:
* The MVP of this project should aim to show correlation (or lack thereof) of certain attributes and injury rates of NBA players
